	What Careers Are There in Software Engineering?

Career opportunities in software engineering are driven by new technologies in automobiles, aviation, data management, telecommunications, factory control, robotics, defense, and security. Software engineers may develop computer games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems, and more. A bachelor's degree or higher is often required to work as a software engineer.

Two common jobs within software engineering are applications developers and systems developers.

Applications developers design computer applications, such as games, for consumers. They may create custom software for a specific customer or commercial software to be sold to the general public. Some applications developers create databases or programs for use internally or online.

Systems developers create operating systems, either for the public or for an organization. These operating systems keep computers functioning and control most of the consumer electronics in use today, including those in cell phones and cars. Often, systems developers also build the interface that allows users to interact with the computer.

Of course, applications and systems developer jobs are not the only two positions available in the field of software engineering. Other common roles include mobile developers, applications architects, quality assurance analysts, and database administrators.

Some common job titles for software engineers include:

Applications Architect
Applications Developer
Computer Applications Engineer
Database Administrator
Mobile Developer
Program Manager
Programmer
Project Leader
Quality Assurance Analyst
Software Engineer
Software Quality Engineer
Systems Analyst
Systems Developer
What Tasks do Software Engineers do?
Successful software engineers use programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network control systems. In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers.
