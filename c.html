Types of Web Developers
Front-End Developer
These web developers focus on the user-facing sides of websites. They create intuitive user interfaces with a keen eye for compelling design.
Back-End Developer
Back-end developers specialize in websites' nuts and bolts, optimizing the crucial hidden elements most users never see. They often design databases and use languages like PHP, CSS, or Python.
Full-Stack Developer
Full-stack web developers combine front-end and back-end development. They consider the creation process from both angles and possess the skills to complete tasks on either end of the spectrum
What Do Web Developers Do?
Web developers typically work with web-based application servers, desktop or notebook computers, and other programming devices. They use those tools to develop the coding processes for functional and visually compelling websites. When writing code, web developers use languages like HTML, Python, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and CSS.

Web development also includes site maintenance and upkeep. In addition to design, qualified professionals evaluate code for accuracy, redundancies, and structural integrity. They increase site performance by enhancing server-side components and optimizing site elements for scalability or outside integration.

Web developers often work alongside other professionals in web design and software development. These fields share some similarities, but the following information details some key differences to keep in mind.

Steps to Become a Web Developer
Skilled web developers must complete formal education, gain practical experience, build a resume and portfolio, and, in some cases, earn additional certifications. Find out more about how each step can advance your career below.

1. Earn Degree(s)
An aspiring web developer must first complete an education to develop basic coding and programming skills. In most cases, this is a computer science degree program with core courses in systems design, data management, and the essential programming languages used by industry professionals.

An associate degree in computer science typically takes two years to complete, while a bachelor's degree in computer science could require four years. Senior-level roles may require more advanced education, like a master's or a doctorate, which include several more years beyond a bachelor's.

The level of education required for employment varies among companies and sectors. While it is possible to land an entry-level web development position with an associate degree or certificate, a bachelor's degree will open up a wider range of opportunities and better position you for future advancement.

2. Pursue Internship(s)
Landing a solid internship as a new web developer provides vital work experience. Internship opportunities give learners the chance to apply their knowledge and develop new skills as they engage with clients and collaborate with other developers.

Some web developer degree programs provide internship placements. If your program does not provide placements, ask around your professional network. Employers and corporate partners often sponsor internship opportunities for new web developers.

3. Build Your Portfolio
Keeping an updated portfolio that highlights the quality and breadth of your accomplishments will appeal to potential employers. Some companies may require a portfolio when applying.

Capstone course materials, completed work from past internships, and aspects of current side projects all make great portfolio items. Web developer programs often feature resources and opportunities to help build relevant portfolios.

4. Earn Certification(s)
Certificates in web development offer several distinct advantages. These programs attest to any additional skills or coding competencies learners possess and keep professionals up to date with the latest developments in this evolving field. A certificate can also give applicants an extra boost on the job hunt.

Some schools offer standalone certificates in front-end or full-stack web development. Conversely, businesses like Microsoft, Adobe, and Amazon offer exam-based certifications in areas like JavaScript and cloud development. Zend has similar opportunities in PHP training. Certification renewal requirements vary by provider.

5. Create Your Resume
Every aspiring web developer needs a concise and informative resume. This document is an extension of your professional self, so it's important to know how to build a resume that accurately conveys your value and worth.

Successful resumes highlight the skills and qualifications that make individuals stand among other job candidates. Applicants should list their programming competencies and coding languages, education and professional experience, and any other technical skills or industry certifications.

Interview with an Expert
Portrait of James Hoff
James Hoff
James Hoff has been creating web applications since 1999. Reluctantly foregoing his childhood dream of playing baseball for the New York Mets, he decided to pursue his favorite childhood hobby as a full-time career: computer programming. His core interests include database-driven web applications, web standards compliance, and SEO-friendly code. Hoff graduated in 2002 from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor of science in computer science. He began working with Boomtown Internet Group in 2006. Outside of programming, his interests include baseball, weightlifting, and reformed theology.

Why become a web developer? What are some challenges and high points in this role? What type of person does well in this role?
The most compelling reason to get into the field of web development is the high demand for this expertise. Nearly all homes and technologies in the developed world are connected to the internet and have some type of interaction with a website. The job opportunities are seemingly limitless.

Furthermore, the general heading "web development" encompasses a wide range of interests and activities. There is no single job description for "web development" in general. Some developers put on a suit and write code for banks. Other developers wear pajamas and write code in their home office for the mom and pop shop down the street.

Because it does take some math and programming education to break into the field, the profession is usually a best fit for detail-oriented people with a fundamental love of technology and the web. It is a highly rewarding experience to create a website from the ground up and to see it live in the wild.

What skills do employers look for when hiring web developers? What advice would you give to students about how to land a web development internship?
When hiring a web developer for my business, Boomtown Internet Group, I'm looking for: programming proficiency, attention to detail, and temperament.

A candidate's programming proficiency is make-or-break in their ability to get the job done day to day. A candidate can make themselves stand out to an employer by having proficiency in a range of related programming languages.

Some languages and technologies don't relate to one another, so it may not matter that you know them. Your employer will care about the languages that work in tandem every day to get a website living and breathing on the internet.

Likewise, attention to detail is a quality that will make-or-break a candidate's ability to perform. Web development is a profession where a single misplaced character can bring an entire website down! So there is sometimes a lot of power in a programmer's hands.

As an employer, I'm looking for a candidate who can wield that power with great discipline and control. It may seem odd that a candidate's temperament plays into the equation here, but web developers are almost always working on a team. Your ability to concede to another developer's strategy or to use a language that is not your first choice is a very important quality.

In fact, temperament and attitude can be a great "in" when you don't have all of the technical qualifications for a given position. This is especially true when seeking an internship because you're using the position to learn the technical. You will need the good temperament and attitude to play well on the team and to learn from other, more experienced developers.

What's a typical day for a web developer? Who do you communicate with? What kind of hours do you keep?
Web development is essentially a constant journey in problem solving. One moment you're solving a conceptual problem (a problem in your head — "how do we solve this at all?") and the next you're solving the same problem in code (a problem on the screen — "how does this solution translate to the website?").

You'll be working on tasks related to both website design and function. The website visitor plainly sees the design, while they will not see the code that makes it function.

You'll be working all alone on some tasks or with a larger team on others. When working with a team, you'll discover the variety in your team's personalities very quickly. Some developers are quick thinkers who adopt new technologies with open arms. Other developers are more methodical, skeptical of the latest coding frameworks, and may adopt new technologies more slowly. A web development team benefits from ALL of these personality types!

Another difference between developers is in their ability to communicate directly with the client. Some employers will expect you to communicate with the client directly, while others will allow you to write code all day and leave the communication to management. Depending on the employer, you may also put in a straight 8-hour day or you may work 4 hours here and 4 hours there.

From my experience, some problems are so challenging that there is benefit in taking a break and coming back later with a "fresh set of eyes." Other problems can only be solved by tackling them from start to finish. As such, the typical day in web development is anything but typical and makes for a highly rewarding profession!
